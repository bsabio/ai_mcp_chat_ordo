/**
 * Catalog-driven role directive assembler.

 * Sprint 13: Replaces the monolithic ROLE_DIRECTIVES object with a function
 * that assembles directives from three sources:
 *   1. Role-level framing (hardcoded per role)
 *   2. Tool-specific guidance from catalog promptHint facets
 *   3. Dynamic job-status directive lines
 *
 * Content that CANNOT move to the catalog stays hardcoded:
 *   - Role-level framing ("ROLE CONTEXT — ...")
 *   - corpus_* MCP tool descriptions (MCP-only, not in CAPABILITY_CATALOG)
 *   - Operator format guidance (NOW/NEXT/WAIT)
 *   - getJobStatusDirectiveLines() (dynamic, strategy-driven)
